<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>My CS Journey</h2>
<p>
    My programming journey began in middle school with online HTML and CSS tutorials, but my interest in computer science did not truly develop until my sophomore year of high school. It was the first year my school offered a computer science course (AP Computer Science Principles), and I reluctantly signed up because I was told “CS is the future.” However, that was one of the best choices I have ever made. The class ignited my ambition to solve problems and create programs out of “nothing.” I loved how it allowed me to combine both my logical and creative skills. I felt as though I had unlocked a tool that made any problem achievable. And while my school did not offer any other computer science classes, I continued to embrace my passion by taking college courses and tutoring students on computer science concepts.

    Coming from a small, not very technologically advanced school in South Carolina, I had only really heard about this mysterious “AI,” but did not understand what it was, and that fascinated me. I wanted to know more about what it was, how it worked, and its applications. The summer before I began college, I spent hours emailing research professors practically begging for an opportunity to aid in any project in AI. After dozens of emails, finally one professor took a chance on me, and allowed me to work on his research project applying predictive models to Hamster Cell Growth. This opportunity allowed me to understand more about AI, work within one of its applications, and open my eyes to even more of its applications. Even though I no longer work on this project, I carry that same excitement and wonder with me into every other challenge I tackle today.

<h2>Outside of Computer Science</h2>
<p>
    My love for learning persists beyond computer science.
</p>
<p>
    I picked up my physics minor after having my mind-blown (in a good way) by my first physics class at Clemson University. I immediately wanted to know more, so in addition to taking extra physics classes, I am an avid listener to StarTalk by Dr. Neil Degrasse Tyson.
</p>
<p>
    Outside of academia, I also enjoy learning to play instruments, reading dystopian and sci-fi novels, visiting museums, and hiking. Even though this is the Outside of Computer Science section, I must highlight that computer science intertwines with these hobbies, as seen in my climate crisis film repository project – a product of my love for nature and fascination with dystopian narratives.
