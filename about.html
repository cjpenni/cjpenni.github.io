                Welcome! I'm Connor Pennington, a passionate computer science student with a deep fascination 
                for artificial intelligence and machine learning. My journey in technology is driven by an 
                insatiable curiosity to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions.

        <h2>My CS Journey</h2>
        
        <div class="card">
            <p>
                My programming journey began in middle school with online HTML and CSS tutorials, but my 
                interest in computer science did not truly develop until my sophomore year of high school. 
                It was the first year my school offered a computer science course (AP Computer Science Principles), 
                and I reluctantly signed up because I was told "CS is the future." However, that was one of 
                the best choices I have ever made.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The class ignited my ambition to solve problems and create programs out of "nothing." I loved 
                how it allowed me to combine both my logical and creative skills. I felt as though I had 
                unlocked a tool that made any problem achievable. And while my school did not offer any other 
                computer science classes, I continued to embrace my passion by taking college courses and 
                tutoring students on computer science concepts.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Coming from a small, not very technologically advanced school in South Carolina, I had only 
                really heard about this mysterious "AI," but did not understand what it was, and that fascinated 
                me. I wanted to know more about what it was, how it worked, and its applications. The summer 
                before I began college, I spent hours emailing research professors practically begging for an 
                opportunity to aid in any project in AI.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After dozens of emails, finally one professor took a chance on me, and allowed me to work on 
                his research project applying predictive models to Hamster Cell Growth. This opportunity allowed 
                me to understand more about AI, work within one of its applications, and open my eyes to even 
                more of its applications. Even though I no longer work on this project, I carry that same 
                excitement and wonder with me into every other challenge I tackle today.

        <div class="card">
            <p>
                My love for learning persists beyond computer science. I picked up my physics minor after 
                having my mind-blown (in a good way) by my first physics class at Clemson University. I 
                immediately wanted to know more, so in addition to taking extra physics classes, I am an 
                avid listener to StarTalk by Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Outside of academia, I also enjoy learning to play instruments, reading dystopian and sci-fi 
                novels, visiting museums, and hiking. Even though this is the "Beyond Computer Science" section, 
                I must highlight that computer science intertwines with these hobbies, as seen in my climate 
                crisis film repository project - a product of my love for nature and fascination with dystopian 
                narratives.
