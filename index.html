<h2>Experience</h2>
<h3>Software Engineer Intern | 402 Software Engineering Group - Summer 2024</h3>
<p>
    Leveraged machine learning by implementing a model trained on 1 million PDFs to automate table extraction from over 600 unique formats. Created an algorithm to programmatically reformat the tabular data into XML, XAML, and .cs files. This resulted in a 20% increase in software development productivity by eliminating the need for manual table extraction and reformatting.
